## Milestone Roadmap: Missing monthly_plan Investigation Strategy

Goal: Identify why `roadmap_plan` in `sheet1!E` isnâ€™t parsed as an object with `monthly_plan` array.

Checklist (run in order):

1) Verify sheet connectivity
- Hit GET `/api/milestone-roadmap/:userId` directly in browser.
- Expect HTTP 200 and JSON with keys: `userId`, `username`, `roadmapPlan`, `roadmapProgress`.

2) Inspect raw cell and parsing path
- Add logs and a debug endpoint to return:
  - Header row, matched row index
  - Raw `E` cell length and a short preview
  - Parsed plan keys and whether `monthly_plan` is an array
  - A sanitized-key pass (normalize keys like `monthlyPlan`, `monthly plan`, `monthly_plan`, or hidden unicode) and re-check

3) Normalize and decode
- Decode HTML entities in the raw string.
- Extract the JSON substring between the first `{` and last `}` if extra characters exist.
- Parse double-encoded JSON if needed.
- Normalize plan object keys by stripping non-letters and lowercasing, mapping any variant matching `monthlyplan` to `monthly_plan`.

4) Confirm fix
- After redeploy, hit GET `/api/milestone-debug/:userId` and check:
  - `hasMonthlyPlanArrayBefore` and `hasMonthlyPlanArrayAfter` are true, `monthly_plan_length` is 12.
- Reload widget page; it should render the roadmap.

If still failing:
- Dump the exact code points of the matching key to detect invisible characters.
- Fallback: Manually parse `E` cell to JSON and directly construct `{ monthly_plan: value.monthly_plan || value.monthlyPlan || value[<detected key>] }`.
