# Milestone Widget

A server-rendered widget that displays a personalized, self‚Äëpaced 10‚Äëmilestone learning journey with dual-track progress: course completion AND real-world goal achievement. Served directly from an Express server.

## What's Included

- Milestone Journey widget: shows a personalized, self‚Äëpaced 10‚Äëmilestone journey with current milestone focus, course recommendation, and personalized subgoal
- Dual-track progress system: tracks both course completion and assignment submissions
- LearnWorlds OAuth2 integration for live course progress and assignment tracking
- Google Sheets as the data store for plans and progress
- Personalized northstar goal calibration for achievable outcomes in 3-12 months

## How It Works

### Data Flow
- Plan JSON (the 10‚Äëmilestone roadmap with personalized subgoals) is stored in Google Sheets under `MILESTONE_SPREADSHEET_ID`, tab `sheet1`, column E.
- Progress JSON (dual-track completion state) is stored in the same sheet, column F.
- The server renders the Milestone widget (`/milestone-roadmap/:userId`) which:
  - Loads the plan/progress via `/api/milestone-roadmap/:userId`
  - Renders a header, current milestone detail, and a vertical timeline
  - Shows a recommended course with live progress via `/api/course-progress/:userId/course/:courseId`
  - Shows personalized subgoal assignment status via `/api/assignment-status/:userId/assignment/:assignmentId`
  - Marks milestones complete ONLY when BOTH course AND assignment are completed
  - Overview (Milestone 0) auto-completes on first view

### Dual-Track Completion System
Each milestone requires TWO completions:
1. **Knowledge Track**: Complete the recommended LearnWorlds course (100% progress)
2. **Application Track**: Submit and get approval for the milestone assignment in the "Milestones" course

Students must achieve both to advance to the next milestone, ensuring they not only learn concepts but also apply them toward their personalized northstar goal.

## Progress JSON Schema

The progress tracking (column F) uses this enhanced structure:

```json
{
  "userId": "string",
  "currentMilestone": 2,
  "milestonesCompleted": [0, 1],
  "milestoneProgress": {
    "0": {
      "completed": true,
      "completedDate": "2024-04-14T09:00:00Z"
    },
    "1": {
      "courseCompleted": true,
      "courseCompletedDate": "2024-04-15T10:00:00Z",
      "assignmentSubmitted": true,
      "assignmentApproved": true,
      "assignmentApprovedDate": "2024-04-16T10:00:00Z",
      "completed": true,
      "completedDate": "2024-04-16T10:00:00Z"
    },
    "2": {
      "courseCompleted": true,
      "courseCompletedDate": "2024-04-20T10:00:00Z",
      "assignmentSubmitted": true,
      "assignmentApproved": false,
      "completed": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Progress Logic
- **First Visit**: New users start at Milestone 1 (Overview auto-completes on first view)
- **Current Milestone**: Always the next milestone after the highest completed one
- **Dual-Track Completion**: Milestone marked complete ONLY when:
  1. Associated LearnWorlds course reaches 100% completion
  2. Milestone assignment is submitted AND approved by mentor
- **Overview Auto-Complete**: Milestone 0 (Overview) automatically completes when first viewed (no assignment required)
- **Automatic Advancement**: When both tracks of a milestone are completed, the system advances to the next milestone
- **Partial Progress**: Students can complete courses ahead of assignments, but milestone won't advance until both are done

## Plan JSON Schema

The plan JSON (column E) expects this enhanced shape with personalized northstar and subgoals:

```json
{
  "northstar": {
    "original_dream": "Become a world-famous darkwave artist",
    "achievable_goal": "Release a 5-track darkwave EP and build a community of 500 engaged fans",
    "timeframe": "3-12 months",
    "success_metrics": [
      "5 professionally produced tracks",
      "500 genuine fans across platforms",
      "3 live performances or DJ sets"
    ]
  },
  "welcome": "string",
  "overview": "string",
  "milestones": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "focus": "Foundation Building",
      "goal": "Be able to create authentic darkwave chord progressions",
      "course_rec": {
        "title": "Music Theory Fundamentals",
        "courseId": "course_abc123",
        "url": "string",
        "benefit": "Understand the harmonic language of darkwave"
      },
      "subgoal": {
        "title": "Create your first darkwave chord progression",
        "description": "Apply music theory to create an authentic darkwave progression",
        "deliverable": "Submit a 16-bar progression with bass line",
        "alignment": "Directly applies music theory concepts from the course",
        "learnworlds_assignment_id": "assign_123"
      }
    }
    // ... 10 total entries, ordered as Milestones 1..10
  ],
  "halves": { "H1": "string", "H2": "string" },
  "kpi": ["string", "string", "string", "string"],
  "support_channels": ["string", "string"]
}
```

### Northstar Goal Calibration
- **original_dream**: The student's ultimate vision (may take years to fully achieve)
- **achievable_goal**: A realistic goal achievable in 3-12 months depending on time commitment
- **timeframe**: Expected completion timeframe ("3-12 months")
- **success_metrics**: Measurable outcomes that define success

### Milestone Structure
- **course_rec**: Recommended course with `courseId` for progress tracking
- **subgoal**: Personalized assignment that applies course knowledge toward the northstar goal
  - **title**: What the student will accomplish
  - **description**: Context and purpose
  - **deliverable**: Specific work product to submit
  - **alignment**: How it relates to the course content
  - **learnworlds_assignment_id**: ID of the assignment in the Milestones course

Notes:
- Each milestone combines knowledge acquisition (course) with practical application (subgoal)
- Subgoals progressively build toward the achievable northstar goal
- The 10th milestone's subgoal should essentially complete the northstar goal
- All subgoals are personalized based on the student's specific northstar

  const assignmentApproved = await getAssignmentStatus(userId, milestone10.assignmentId).approved;
  
  if (courseComplete && assignmentApproved) {
    // Northstar achieved!
    progress.journeyCompleted = true;
    progress.northstarAchieved = true;
    progress.completionDate = new Date().toISOString();
    progress.currentMilestone = "completed";
    
    // Calculate portfolio items from all approved assignments
    progress.portfolio = await compilePortfolio(userId);
  }
}

// New endpoint for northstar achievement data
app.get('/api/milestone-roadmap/:userId/northstar-achievement', async (req, res) => {
  // Return:
  // - Original dream vs achieved goal
  // - All 10 deliverables/portfolio items
  // - Success metrics achievement

  showNorthstarAchievementView({
    achievedGoal: plan.northstar.achievable_goal,
    originalDream: plan.northstar.original_dream,
    portfolio: progress.portfolio,
    metrics: plan.northstar.success_metrics,
    duration: calculateJourneyDuration(progress)
  });
}
```

#### 5. **Data Schema Updates**

**Enhanced Progress JSON for Completion:**
