# Futureproof Planning



### Student Experience & App Development

- UI improvements needed for milestone workflow:




  - Make North Star goal more prominent with H1 font and profile picture
  - Combine course and milestone sections into single box
  - Change “goal” to “skills you’ll learn”
  - Remove quiz/project shortcuts to prevent skipping around




  - Use actionable milestone titles (e.g., “Improve your workflow” vs “Workflow”)
